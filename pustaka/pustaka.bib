	abstract = {Segmentation of microvascular structures, such as arterioles, venules, and capillaries, from human kidney whole slide images (WSI) has become a focal point in renal pathology. Current manual segmentation techniques are time-consuming and not feasible for large-scale digital pathology images. While deep learning-based methods offer a solution for automatic segmentation, most suffer from a limitation: they are designed for and restricted to training on single-site, single-scale data. In this paper, we present Omni-Seg, a novel single dynamic network method that capitalizes on multi-site, multiscale training data. Unique to our approach, we utilize partially labeled images, where only one tissue type is labeled per training image, to segment microvascular structures. We train a singular deep network using images from two datasets, HuBMAP and NEPTUNE, across different magnifications (40×, 20×, 10×, and 5×). Experimental results indicate that Omni-Seg outperforms in terms of both the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU). Our proposed method provides renal pathologists with a powerful computational tool for the quantitative analysis of renal microvascular structures.},

              Understanding kidney disease relies on defining the complexity of cell types and states, their associated molecular profiles and interactions within tissue neighbourhoods
              1
              . Here we applied multiple single-cell and single-nucleus assays ({\textgreater}400,000 nuclei or cells) and spatial imaging technologies to a broad spectrum of healthy reference kidneys (45 donors) and diseased kidneys (48 patients). This has provided a high-resolution cellular atlas of 51 main cell types, which include rare and previously undescribed cell populations. The multi-omic approach provides detailed transcriptomic profiles, regulatory factors and spatial localizations spanning the entire kidney. We also define 28 cellular states across nephron segments and interstitium that were altered in kidney injury, encompassing cycling, adaptive (successful or maladaptive repair), transitioning and degenerative states. Molecular signatures permitted the localization of these states within injury neighbourhoods using spatial transcriptomics, while large-scale 3D imaging analysis (around 1.2 million neighbourhoods) provided corresponding linkages to active immune responses. These analyses defined biological pathways that are relevant to injury time-course and niches, including signatures underlying epithelial repair that predicted maladaptive states associated with a decline in kidney function. This integrated multimodal spatial cell atlas of healthy and diseased human kidneys represents a comprehensive benchmark of cellular states, neighbourhoods, outcome-associated signatures and publicly available interactive visualizations.},

	abstract = {Several ongoing international efforts are developing methods of localizing single cells within organs or mapping the entire human body at the single cell level, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and the Knut and Allice Wallenberg Foundation’s Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and the National Institutes of Health’s Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). Their goals are to understand cell specialization, interactions, spatial organization in their natural context, and ultimately the function of every cell within the body. In the same way that the Human Genome Project had to assemble sequence data from different people to construct a complete sequence, multiple centers around the world are collecting tissue specimens from diverse populations that vary in age, race, sex, and body size. A challenge will be combining these heterogeneous tissue samples into a 3D reference map that will enable multiscale, multidimensional Google Maps-like exploration of the human body. Key to making alignment of tissue samples work is identifying and using a coordinate system called a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), which deﬁnes the positions, or “addresses,” in a reference body, from whole organs down to functional tissue units and individual cells. In this perspective, we examine the concept of a CCF based on the vasculature and describe why it would be an attractive choice for mapping the human body.},

This study retrospectively reviews recent studies on the application of deep learning for segmentation tasks in medical imaging and proposes potential directions for future development, including model development, data augmentation processing, and dataset creation. The strengths and deﬁciencies of studies on models and data augmentation, as well as their application to medical image segmentation, were analyzed. Fully convolutional network developments have led to the creation of the U-Net and its derivatives. Another noteworthy image segmentation model is DeepLab. Regarding data augmentation, due to the low data volume of medical images, most studies focus on means to increase the wealth of medical image data. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) increase data volume via deep learning. Despite the increasing types of medical image datasets, there is still a deﬁciency of datasets on speciﬁc problems, which should be improved moving forward. Considering the wealth of ongoing research on the application of deep learning processing to medical image segmentation, the data volume and practical clinical application problems must be addressed to ensure that the results are properly applied.},

Third, the global context information of diﬀerent scales is ignored. In this paper, we try to eliminate semantic ambiguity in skip connection operations by adding attention gates (AGs), and use attention mechanisms to combine local features with their corresponding global dependencies, explicitly model the dependencies between channels and use multiscale predictive fusion to utilize global information at diﬀerent scales. Compared with other state-of-theart segmentation networks, our model obtains better segmentation performance while introducing fewer parameters.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Manual or automatic delineation of the esophageal tumor in CT images is known to be very challenging. This is due to the low contrast between the tumor and adjacent tissues, the anatomical variation of the esophagus, as well as the occasional presence of foreign bodies (e.g. feeding tubes). Physicians therefore usually exploit additional knowledge such as endoscopic ﬁndings, clinical history, additional imaging modalities like PET scans. Achieving his additional information is time-consuming, while the results are error-prone and might lead to non-deterministic results. In this paper we aim to investigate if and to what extent a simpliﬁed clinical workﬂow based on CT alone, allows one to automatically segment the esophageal tumor with sufﬁcient quality. For this purpose, we present a fully automatic end-to-end esophageal tumor segmentation method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network, called Dilated Dense Attention Unet (DDAUnet), leverages spatial and channel attention gates in each dense block to selectively concentrate on determinant feature maps and regions. Dilated convolutional layers are used to manage GPU memory and increase the network receptive ﬁeld. We collected a dataset of 792 scans from 288 distinct patients including varying anatomies with air pockets, feeding tubes and proximal tumors. Repeatability and reproducibility studies were conducted for three distinct splits of training and validation sets. The proposed network achieved a DSC value of 0.79 ± 0.20, a mean surface distance of 5.4 ± 20.2mm and 95\% Hausdorff distance of 14.7 ± 25.0mm for 287 test scans, demonstrating promising results with a simpliﬁed clinical workﬂow based on CT alone.

	abstract = {Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computational model that uses multiple layers of interconnected units (neurons) to learn intricate patterns and representations directly from raw input data. Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is a challenging task due to the algorithm’s complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art of deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures. Finally, challenges and future directions in deep learning research are discussed to offer a broader perspective for future researchers.},

	abstract = {Computer-assisted quantitative analysis on Giga-pixel pathology images has provided a new avenue in histology examination. The innovations have been largely focused on cancer pathology (i.e., tumor segmentation and characterization). In non-cancer pathology, the learning algorithms can be asked to examine more comprehensive tissue types simultaneously, as a multi-label setting. The prior arts typically needed to train multiple segmentation networks in order to match the domain-speciﬁc knowledge for heterogeneous tissue types (e.g., glomerular tuft, glomerular unit, proximal tubular, distal tubular, peritubular capillaries, and arteries). In this paper, we propose a dynamic single segmentation network (Omni-Seg) that learns to segment multiple tissue types using partially labeled images (i.e., only one tissue type is labeled for each training image) for renal pathology. By learning from 150,000 patch-wise pathological images from six tissue types, the proposed Omni-Seg network achieved superior segmentation accuracy and less resource consumption when compared to the previous the multiple-network and multi-head design. In the testing stage, the proposed method obtains “completely labeled” tissue segmentation results using only “partially labeled” training images.

	abstract = {The kidney plays important roles in homeostasis of body fluid and electrolyte balances as well as blood pressure (BP) regulation. For these, two functions are required. One is a stable and huge (150L/day) amount of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the face of large variations of BP and dairy salt intake, and the other is pressure natriuresis. Even if BP changed acutely, glomerular capillary pressure of each nephron is maintained relatively stale by myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). When salt intake is changed, GFR is maintained by exquisitely precise and elegant interplays among the rein-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system, TGF and connecting TGF (cTGF). The cTGF is a recently discovered intrinsic mechanism controlling glomerular hemodynamics. The pressure natriuresis plays a crucial role in the maintenance of body fluid volume, and its site of action is renal medulla. Blood supply to renal medulla is governed by descending vasa recta, the efferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerulus. In outer medulla, thick ascending limb of juxtamedullary nephron makes direct contact with descending vasa recta. Studies indicate that nitric oxide and oxidative stress produced by this tubular segment affect vascular tone of descending vasa recta, a phenomenon called tubulo-vascular crosstalk. The tubule-vascular crosstalk is implicated to play an important role in oxygen metabolism in such conditions as heart failure and high salt intake. In this presentation, I will discuss above mentioned mechanisms that control renal hemodynamics, sodium balances and BP.},

	abstract = {The kidney is a critical regulator of blood pressure (BP) and a contributor to cardiovascular health. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential mediators of genetic predisposition to cardiovascular and kidney disorders, yet their overall role in blood pressure control has not been fully characterised. We sought to identify and catalogue all renal miRNAs, investigate which of them are genetically regulated and assess whether their expression-modifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlap with genetic variants associated with BP in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
              We first characterised the entire renal miRNA transcriptome through de novo small RNA-sequencing of 493 human kidney samples. We then integrated these expression profiles with genotype information to perform expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis - the largest of its kind - and identify genetically regulated miRNAs and their regulatory SNPs. We then examined the extent to which miRNA-regulating variants overlapped with the curated list of BP-associated GWAS SNPs.
              We identified 1,459 mature miRNAs expressed in the human kidney, and the top 50 most highly expressed miRNAs accounted for 24.2\% of the measured expression. We also discovered that 78\% of miRNA genes expressed in the kidney were intragenic to other genes and 58\% mapped to an intron of those genes. After correction for multiple testing, our eQTL analysis had identified 140 genetically regulated miRNAs in the kidney. They were controlled by 19,901 unique SNPs (eSNPs) with a total of 21,805 miRNA-eSNP pairs. Functional annotation of miRNA eSNPs demonstrated 2.54-fold enrichment for kidney enhancer regions and 1.69-fold enrichment for kidney promoters when compared to randomly selected SNPs. Through overlap with GWAS SNPs for systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures, we identified 8 kidney BP miRNA eSNPs responsible for the regulation of 9 mature miRNAs.
              Collectively, we generated a catalogue of miRNAs expressed in the human kidney, annotated novel kidney relevant miRNAs and their regulatory variants and discovered 9 renal microRNAs that may act as mediators of genetic predisposition to high BP.},

	abstract = {Pathologies of the brain microvasculature, often referred to as cerebral small-vessel disease, are important contributors to vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia in aging societies. In addition to their role in acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, they have emerged as major cause of age-related cognitive decline in asymptomatic individuals. A central histological finding in these pathologies is the disruption of the vessel architecture including thickening of the vessel wall, narrowing of the vessel lumen and massive expansion of the mural extracellular matrix. The underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown, but from the investigation of several disease forms with defined etiology, high temperature requirement protein A1 (HTRA1), a secreted serine protease degrading primarily matrisomal substrates, has emerged as critical factor and potential therapeutic target. A genetically induced loss of HTRA1 function in humans is associated with cerebral autosomal-recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), a rare, hereditary form of brain microvascular disease. Recently, proteomic studies on cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a common cause of age-related dementia, and cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most prevalent monogenic small-vessel disease, have provided evidence for an impairment of HTRA1 activity through sequestration into pathological protein deposits, suggesting an alternative mechanism of HTRA1 inactivation and expanding the range of diseases with HTRA1 involvement. Further investigations of the mechanisms of HTRA1 regulation in the brain microvasculature might spawn novel strategies for the treatment of small-vessel pathologies.},

	abstract = {Introduction. The study of microcirculation processes in peripheral nerve damage remains a necessary area of experimental and clinical research, because the microvascular bed is one of the most important systems in which the disease manifests itself in the early stages. The aim of the study is to identify the role of microcirculation disorders in the state of central and peripheral conductive structures in patients with vibration disease (VD) associated with combined exposure to general and local vibration, and burdened with metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Materials and methods. Group 1 included patients with VD associated with combined exposure to general and local vibration, group 2 - persons diagnosed with VD, burdened with MS, group 3 - with a diagnosis of VD, burdened with DM. At the 1st stage of the study, basal blood flow was studied, at the 2 nd stage - load functional tests (respiratory and occlusive). The state of sensory and motor axons of the nervous system was determined. Results. In patients of the examined groups, there was proved a relationship between the indicators of the state of peripheral nerves and central structures with the indicators of microcirculation, the state of the myogenic level of regulation, with the index of specific oxygen consumption and the index of relative perfusion oxygen saturation in the microcirculation. In patients with VD, burdened with MS and DM, an association was found between changes in axons with an indicator of the intensity of functioning of the regulatory systems of the microvascular bed, indicators of the levels of active regulation of microcirculation (myogenic, neurogenic and endothelial) and indicators characterizing the dynamic state of the microcirculation system. Limitations. The disadvantage of the study is the fact that the parameters of the microcirculation system determined in the peripheral departments were extrapolated to the central structures, and were not determined in the capillary network of the brain. Conclusion. Changes in the microcirculatory bed were established to be a link in the pathogenesis of demyelination processes in VB associated with the combined effects of general and local vibration, and vibration disease burdened with MS and DM.},
