The microvascular structure in human kidneys plays a crucial role in bodily functions, yet manual segmentation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise in histology. The complexity of microvascular structures presents significant challenges in developing automated segmentation methods. This study evaluates the Attention U-Net model for microvascular segmentation in Whole Slide Images (WSI) of human kidney tissue by incorporating attention gate modules into the U-Net architecture to improve accuracy. The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) and annotated by histology experts. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 4 to achieve optimal performance and evaluated using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, and recall. The results indicate that the Attention U-Net outperforms the standard U-Net across all key metrics. The attention gate mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant areas, thereby enhancing its capability in detecting small blood vessels.}
